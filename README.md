# Movie Recommendation System
In today’s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

The task is to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

There are two broad groups of approaches for doing this task: collaborative filtering methods and content-based methods.

collaborative filtering — based on user rating and consumption to group similar users together, then to recommend products/services to users

content-based filters — to make recommendations based on similar products/services according to their attributes.
